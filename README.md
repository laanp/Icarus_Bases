# Icarus_Bases
A collection of downloadable Icarus bases
By Peter Laan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bases should be forward compatible with all versions of Icarus.

### Description:
Welcome to my laanp_Icarus_Bases repository on github!

This is currently under construction, but stay tuned and visit often to see updates.

The intent of this repository is to share some of my base builds in Icarus with other folks who love the game the way I do.
I enjoy building in the game, and thought it would be cool to share some of my creations.  Feel free to build on them, share them all you want.


### Map Locations: 
I have also included (3) maps, Olympus, Styx & Prometheus, to identify where the bases are located in each of their respective Open World prospect.

### Prospect Installation: 
"Prospects" is a generic name for any mission, outpost, or open world map session in the game Icarus-First Cohort.  
All of my shared prospects are open worlds. 
Anything you build within the prospect, is all stored in a single json file stored on your local PC in the following directory:  
\<drive\>\Users\<Username\>\AppData\Local\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\<UserAccount#\>\Prospects

If you are running a Dedicated Server, the location to store the prospects on the server will be:  
\<drive\>\\<IcarusServerFolder\>\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\DedicatedServer\Prospects

Where:  
  \<drive\> = The disk (ie: "C:" or "D:") where the files are installed on.  
  \<Username\> = Your PC username in Windows  
  \<UserAccount#\> = Your user account number for Icarus (will be something like: "75661197962466207")  
  \<IcarusServerFolder\> = Where you installed the Icarus Dedicated Server app.  
  
Installation of prospects is easy, simply download the desired zip file, *.zip, from the "Latest" release button to the right of this main page, and extract the *.json prospect file into the directories as described above.
Startup Icarus and once you have selected your character, click the "Join" menu and you should see my prospect available in the list.

### Prospect Notes & Mod Use: 
All of my open world prospects were built while I was running (2) of my mods called:
   - laanp-NoWeather
   - Combined_PJM_Pete
Both these mods are available in the Latest Release section.
These mods can both exist in the mods directory and should NOT be merged using the IMM.

I am not saying you must install these mods to use these prospects, however the following side effects will occurr if you startup these prospects without the mods:
   - You will loose alot of resources in storage containers, since all inventory slots have stack modification of 100, normally this is 20 for most items,so you will loose all those resources.  This is irreversible if the prospect saves without mods, unless you restore original prospect from the GitHub.
   - Some buildings use materials that may may be destroyed by weather effects, so NoWeather mod is beneficial.
   - The mod affects power-generating equipment, as well as water pump delivery, so going in with no mods, you might find you now have insufficient power or water supply to your base equipment.
