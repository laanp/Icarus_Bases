# Icarus_Bases
A collection of downloadable Icarus bases
By Peter Laan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bases should be forward compatible with all versions of Icarus.

### Description:
Welcome to my laanp_Icarus_Bases repository on github!

This is currently under construction, but stay tuned and visit often to see updates.

The intent of this repository is to share some of my base builds in Icarus with other folks who love the game the way I do.
I enjoy building in the game, and thought it would be cool to share some of my creations.  Feel free to build on them, share them all you want.


### Map Locations: 
I have also included separate maps for each prospect, that will show approximate locations of your drop pods when you enter the prospect, as well as the base location.
For example "Pete's Olympus OW-9.json" is an open world prospect on the map "Olympus" and the associated map will be called "Pete's Olympus OW-9.jpg"

### Prospect Installation: 
"Prospects" is a generic name for any mission, outpost, or open world map session in the game Icarus-First Cohort.  
All of my shared prospects are open worlds. 
Anything you build within the prospect, is all stored in a single json file stored on your local PC in the following directory:  
\<drive\>\Users\<Username\>\AppData\Local\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\<UserAccount#\>\Prospects

If you are running a Dedicated Server, the location to store the prospects on the server will be:  
\<drive\>\\<IcarusServerFolder\>\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\DedicatedServer\Prospects

Where:  
  \<drive\> = The disk (ie: "C:" or "D:") where the files are installed on.  
  \<Username\> = Your PC username in Windows  
  \<UserAccount#\> = Your user account number for Icarus (will be something like: "75661197962466207")  
  \<IcarusServerFolder\> = Where you installed the Icarus Dedicated Server app.  
  
Installation of prospects is easy, simply download the desired file *.json from the "Latest" release button to the right of this main page, and drop the file into the directories as described above.
Startup Icarus and once you have selected your character, click the "Join" menu and you should see my prospect available in the list.

### Prospect Notes: 
A lot of my open world prospects were built while I was running some of my mods.  This means you may notice a couple of things that are not functioning if you startup these prospects without the mods.  
Most notably will be power for the base.  In my "laanp-BuildersDream" mod I created biofuel generators that can deliver more power, and therefore only installed (1) of them.  Not a big deal, but if you enter the prospect without any mods running, you will need to add additional generators to get the power going.  Same goes with water pumps, you may need to add more of them if needed. 

I also used "laanp-NoWeather" mod when building some of the buidlings, and while I tried to stay consistent with weather-proof design, if you are not runninng any weather mods you may need to toughen up some of the building trim and certain areas as required.
